Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are crucial for immediate medical assistance during life-threatening situations. However, insufficient public awareness about EMS services can impede their effectiveness. This study aimed to assess EMS knowledge and trust among the population of Eastern Saudi Arabia while identifying factors contributing to low awareness. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Eastern Saudi Arabia from September 2022 to September 2023. The study included participants aged 18 to 60 from diverse backgrounds. Using a convenience sampling approach, data was collected using a validated questionnaire covering demographics, hypothetical scenarios, EMS knowledge, and trust in EMS.
can you rephrase this and shorter?

so when i obtain the coefficients, what do they actually mean? lets say I obtained the intercept as -0.284, 0.143 gender coeff, -0.535 education coeff and 1.094 health_professions coeff

In the context of logistic regression, the coefficients represent the change in the log odds of the outcome variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding predictor variable, holding all other variables constant.

Here's how you can interpret the coefficients based on the values you provided:

    Intercept (-0.284): The intercept represents the log odds of the outcome variable (calling EMS) when all predictor variables are zero. Since logistic regression works on the log odds scale, this value indicates the log odds of calling EMS for a hypothetical individual with zero values for Gender, Education, and health_professions.

    Gender Coefficient (0.143): For every one-unit increase in the Gender variable (e.g., moving from male to female, assuming the variable is coded as 0 and 1), the log odds of calling EMS increase by 0.143, holding Education and health_professions constant.

    Education Coefficient (-0.535): For every one-unit increase in the Education variable (e.g., moving from a lower to a higher education level), the log odds of calling EMS decrease by 0.535, holding Gender and health_professions constant.

    Health_professions Coefficient (1.094): For every one-unit increase in the health_professions variable (e.g., a person belonging to a health profession versus not belonging), the log odds of calling EMS increase by 1.094, holding Gender and Education constant.

It's important to note that interpreting coefficients in logistic regression involves considering the log odds scale. If you're interested in interpreting the coefficients in terms of probabilities, you can exponentiate them to obtain odds ratios or probabilities. For example, exponentiating the coefficient of Gender (0.143) would give you the odds ratio associated with a one-unit increase in Gender.
